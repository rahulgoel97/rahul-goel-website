The Art of Doing Science & Engineering 
Learning to Learn
By Richard H Hamming.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
!!! Indicates really interesting and unique insights, recommended to read, with my personal commentary on why it is important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro, Chapter 1-3 
- Notes to be added.
- Thought of this idea while on chapter 3.

Chapter 3 - History of computers - hardware

- Interesting notes on scratches on old bones connected to astronomy.
- Never thought Babbage was the father of modern computing.
- 1935 - IBM mechanical punch could do multiplications and include two additions to the product. Used in Atomic bombs.
- 1939 - George Stibitz build Complex Number Computer. 
- 1946 - ENIAC built by US Army - 18K vacuum tubes, used to compute ballistic trajectories. Same year, Mauchly and Eckert gave a course open to all on how to design and build computers.
- 1952 - MANIAC-I 
- 1955 - MANIAC-II

!!! A lot of above possible due to government funding for military use-cases. This is important in 2022 due to the debates around government funding for science and the creation of a DARPA like agency for health.


- Computer process = 1. Get address in CAR, 2. Go to address and get instruction, 3. Execute instruction, 4. Add to CAR address and repeat.


Chapter 4 - History of computers - software
- Reading in progress...
